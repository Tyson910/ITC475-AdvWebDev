# Pairs 
Created a game of Pairs, also known as Match Match, Memory, or Matching Up, a card game in which all of the 
cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. 
The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards in as little of time as you can.
